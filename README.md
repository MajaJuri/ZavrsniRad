# Serious Green Game "Eko Zeko"
As part of my undergraduate final project, I worked on the development of the green educational game "Eko Zeko". The aim of this game is to educate players on proper waste disposal and raise awareness about the importance of environmental conservation. Users learn about different types of waste, their proper sorting and recycling.

In addition to the educational aspect, the game "Eko Zeko" places special emphasis on accessibility. The implementation of accessibility options ensures that the game is available to as many users as possible, including people with various types of disabilities. This includes customizable controls and visual and auditory signals.
